### What I learned

I struggled with adjusting the illustration and extra box component in my desktop design layout. Using background-position was challenging since I donâ€™t use it often. I found it difficult to tweak the values for proper alignment and to make sure the design responses properly when scaling down the viewport. Through this, I hope to have gained a better understanding of how background-position works and how different position properties affect element placement and responsiveness.

### Continued Development

I will try implementing the design using pure CSS techniques and HTML elements like the details and summary tags. These tags allow for built-in toggling of open and close states, which can simplify handling interactive elements without extra JavaScript.
